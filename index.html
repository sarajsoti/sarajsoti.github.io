            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Hungary has more than a 1,000 year history, since the arrival of the seven chieftans in the Carpathian Basin in 896. The main or leader chieftan was named Arpad, and his great great grandson, Stephen, became the first King of Hungary in the year 1000. Since then, the country has been through Mongol and Turkish invasions, Habsburg rule, revolutions, both World Wars, and Soviet oppression. Hungary was initially 125,642 square miles, with its borders being the Carpathian Mountains, but after WWI, the Treaty of Trianon reduced the country's size to just 35,936 square miles. This stranded many Hungarians outside of their country, where they were often banned from speaking Hungarian. Hungarian is a unique language from the Finno-Ugric language family, and no other countries around Hungary have any relationship to it. Today, there are only about 13 million speakers of the language, 10 million of which live in mainland Hungary.</p>

            <h3>Industrialization</h3>
            <p>The traditional ways of life were drastically changed through industrialization. It made vibrant colors and fabrics accessible to peasants, not just the aristocrats. Their costumes became more ornate, and production of them sped up. Due to industrialization, peasants eventually gave up many of their old occupations for new ones in the factories and moved to cities. Therefore, old occupations and traditions became a thing of the past. Before factories, the women in the villages would gather at the fono, or house where they would spin thread. They would then go through the many steps necessary to create their own fabric, used for things such as clothing and tablecloths, over a period of several months. The advent of industrialization made it much easier to make clothes. After 1830, most of Hungary became a post-feudalist society.

            <h3>Preservation and Revival</h3>
            <p>There were four main people who collected Hungarian music and dances, helping preserve this heritage. Bartok Bela and Kodaly Zoltan collected music, while Pesovar Erno and Gyorgy Martin collected dances. Bartok Bela was a classical composer who wanted to incorporate elements of Hungarian folk music into his classical compositions. Kodaly Zoltan joined him in collecting music from many of the places that were detached from Hungary, where the music was preserved better than in the mother country. Together, they discovered the vast array of musical traditions. Later, Pesovar Erno and Gyorgy Martin took interest in recording the dances of the Hungarians both inside and outside of mainland Hungary, and it is because of these four people that Hungarians today have such a big collection of dances and music. Bartok and Kodaly used phonographs to record music and composed sheet music. Around 1951, Pesovar and Gyorgy were supported by UNESCO and given a camera that recorded sound. Films, photographs, notes, monographs, and other documentation were used to collect information about the music and dances. The methodology of teaching traditional music, dance, and art is an available course of study at universities in Hungary. The youth also created their own places in cities where they could learn folk dances for fun and perform them to the public.</p>

            <h3>Diaspora</h3>
            <p>The new government has put an increased emphasis on preserving national heritage and has invested in these activities, not only within Hungary's borders, but also in Hungarian communities around the world. Those of Hungarian heritage outside of Hungary were allowed to apply for citizenship for the first time. Through the Korosi Csoma Sandor program, young Hungarians are sent on a scholarship to Hungarian communities around the world for six months at a time to support them in programs that serve to advance Hungarian causes and ensure the survival of Hungarian traditions. Today, there are yearly street festivals where they sell Hungarian food and art, and have dance performances, threatre and musical productions. In 2013, the Smithsonian Folklife Festival's theme was Hungarian heritage, and featured a wide spectrum of activities like folk crafts, dance, and music. There are also Hungarian churchs, museums, literary, science, and social clubs, and dance and music groups. Organized dance and music camps are popular, where teachers from Hungary come to teach in areas such as Michigan, Niagara Falls, and Montreal. Children attend weekend schools where they learn to speak Hungarian and learn about Hungary's history and culture.</p>
