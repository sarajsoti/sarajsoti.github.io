          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>Hungary has more than a 1,000 year history, since the arrival of the seven chieftans in the Carpathian Basin in 896. The main or leader chieftan was named Arpad, and his great great grandson, Stephen, became the first King of Hungary in the year 1000. Since then, the country has been through Mongol and Turkish invasions, Habsburg rule, revolutions, both World Wars, and Soviet oppression. Hungary was initially 125,642 square miles, with its borders being the Carpathian Mountains, but after WWI, the Treaty of Trianon reduced the country's size to just 35,936 square miles. This stranded many Hungarians outside of their country, where they were often banned from speaking Hungarian. Hungarian is a unique language from the Finno-Ugric language family, and no other countries around Hungary have any relationship to it. Today, there are only about 13 million speakers of the language, 10 million of which live in mainland Hungary.</p>

          <h3>Industrialization</h3>
          <p>The traditional ways of life were drastically changed through industrialization. It made vibrant colors and fabrics accessible to peasants, not just the aristocrats. Their costumes became more ornate. However, eventually, people gave up many of their old occupations for new ones in the factories, and moved to cities. Therefore, old traditions became a thing of the past.
           Clothing factories, fono.
            Because of industrialization, peasants now had access to colorful clothing and accessories.

          <h3>Preservation and Revival</h3>
          <p>Bartok Bela and Kodaly Zoltan collected music, Pesovar Erno and Gyorgy Martin collected dances. They all worked together to preserve the heritage. They used phonographs to record music and wrote down music notes/sheet music. Films, photographs, notes, and documentation, monographs. UNESCO supported these guys with a camera that recorded sound. The youth started learning from this and created their own places in the cities where they could gather and learn these dances for their own fun and perform in places. </p>

          <h3>Diaspora</h3>
          <p>The new government has put an increased emphasis on preserving national heritage and has invested in these activities not only within Hungary's border, but also in Hungarian communities around the world. Those of Hungarian heritage outside of Hungary were allowed to apply for citizenship for the first time. Through the Korosi Csoma Sandor program, young Hungarians are sent on scholarship to Hungarian communities around the world for six months at a time to support them in programs that serve to advance Hungarian causes and ensure the survival of Hungarian traditions// Hungarians ways. </p>
